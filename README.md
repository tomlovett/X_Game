# X_Game
Coding assignment

This is a coding challenge assigned to a friend of mine. I did it myself for practice.

Find all possible moves in a Double-X Game.
Game rules: Two players begin with an empty set of dashes, like "-----". Players alternate adding adjacent double X's, "XX", to the board until there are no more legal moves. The last player to place double X's wins.
Example game sequences:

-XX----	

-XXXX--			

-XXXXXX			

AND

-----XX

XX---XX

XX-XXXX
